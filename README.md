Project 27 Game files
So, this is done mostly in js, with html handling image rendering. Still needs collision fixed and a few other minor changes. Mostly playable./
Update: Collision is fixed and instructions have been added! ready for feedback.
Update 2: electric boogaloo{
Collision is *Mostly* Working as intended, still not ready for a 1.0 release as i still want to expand the scope of the game a a bit further. 
Now im invested into the game.
Screen formatting needs to be fixed to work with laptops and mobile devices. Hitbox may be made smaller.
